##Bourbon - Meteor Smart Package

This is a simple port of [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon) to meteor.

Bourbon directives are available during the SCSS pre-processing stage, so only the modifications they make to your files are sent to the client.

###How to use

1. Install [meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite)
2. `mrt add scss`
3. `mrt add bourbon`
4. Include `@import "packages/bourbon/bourbon";` in your SCSS, and `@include` away !
